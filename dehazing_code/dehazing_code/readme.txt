Please run the “CO.m”, “CO_DHWT1.m” and “CO_DHWT2.m”, respectively.
 
CO.m is the convex optimization for image dehazing
without Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform (DHWT).

CO_DHWT1.m is the convex optimization 
for image dehazing with single level DHWT.

CO_DHWT2.m is the convex optimization 
for image dehazing with two-level DHWT.
